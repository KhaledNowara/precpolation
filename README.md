Dynamic connectivity solution to estimate percolation threshold. 

The problem. In a famous scientific problem, researchers are interested in the following question: 
if sites are independently set to be open with probability p (and therefore blocked with probability 1 âˆ’ p), 
what is the probability that the system percolates? 

        
When n is sufficiently large, there is a threshold value p* such that when p < p* 
a random n-by-n grid almost never percolates, and when p > p*, a random n-by-n grid almost always percolates. 
No mathematical solution for determining the percolation threshold p* has yet been derived.The aim of this code is to calculate an estimate for the percolatio threshold
